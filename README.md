# JSON.Resume()

Little app to manage the resume. It can be generated and updated by a JSON file.

I wrote it in a day, in a kind of "stream of consciousness", and in the process, I build a framework that reminds me React :D.

## Why
Why do I build a framework from scratch instead of making it directly in plain HTML?
To have fun, of course.

But the reason why I wrote this tool, is because I wanted to have a cv version on GitHub, to take advantage of the versioning. I can make changes and rebuild the cv as releases. Only managing a JSON file.
No more diving into the computer folders to find an old version of the cv and then fight against Microsoft Word or Google Documents or Pages to align that damn table.

## TODO
- [ ] convert the HTML into pdf
- [ ] write a complete JSON
- [ ] work on design
- [ ] document process 
- [ ] host somewhere the HTML version
- [ ] save a pdf version as the first release
