# JSON.Resume()

Little app to manage the resume. It can be generated and updated by a json file.

I wrote it in a day, in a kind of "stream of consciusness", and in the process I build a framework that reminds me React :D.

## Why
Why I build a framework from scratch instead of make id directly in plain html?
To have fun, of course.

But the reason why I wrote this tool, is because I wanted to have a cv version on github, to take advantage of the versioning. I can make changes and rebuild the cv as releases. Only managing a json file.

No more dive into the computer folders to find an old version of the cv and then fight against Microsoft Word or Google Documents or Pages in order to align that damn table.รง

## TODO
- [ ] convert the html into pdf
- [ ] write a complete json
- [ ] work on design
- [ ] document process 
- [ ] host somewhere the html version
- [ ] save a pdf version as first release
